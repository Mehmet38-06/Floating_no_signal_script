 Floating 'NO SIGNAL' Script


Hey everybody,

I stumbled upon a scene while watching The Office series last night. In this scene, Michael was explaining something to his colleagues at a meeting, but no one was listening to him and they were focusing on the TV to see if the "NO SIGNAL" on the screen was right around the corner. In fact, a few scenes later, Jim was saying that Pam saw the text 'NO SIGNAL' come to the corner once. Then it occurred to me to write a Python program that does this job, and here is my code. My code has some shortcomings and maybe we can fix them together. ❤️

Best,
